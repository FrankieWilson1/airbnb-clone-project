### API Security
#### Key Security Measures
1. **Authentication**
   - **Description**:  Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. This will be implemented using secure methods such as OAuth 2.0 or JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
   - **Importance**: Ensures that only legitimate users can access the API, protecting sensitive user data and preventing unauthorized access to the system.
2. **Authorization**
   - **Description**: Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to manage permissions for different user types (e.g., guests and hosts).
   - **Importance**: Prevents users from accessing resources or performing actions that they are not permitted to, thereby protecting critical functionalities and data integrity.
3. **Rate Limiting**
   - **Description**: Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a user can make to the API within a specified time frame. This will help mitigate abuse and ensure fair usage of the API.
   - **Importance**: Protects the API from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and helps maintain performance by preventing any single user from overwhelming the system with excessive requests.
  
4. **Data Encryption**
   - **Description**: All sensitive data, including user credentials and payment information, will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using encryption algorithms).
   - **Importance**: Protects user data from interception during transmission and unauthorized access in storage, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.
  
5. **Input Validation**
   - **Description**: All inputs to the API will be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
   - **Importance**: Ensures that only valid data is processed by the API, reducing the risk of attacks that could compromise the system or lead to data breaches.
  
6. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - **Description**: Implement logging and monitoring to track API usage and detect suspicious activities. This includes logging failed login attempts and monitoring for unusual patterns.
   - **Importance**: Provides visibility into API usage, helps identify potential security incidents, and enables timely responses to threats.
